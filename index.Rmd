# Ancestral reconstruction of foraging mode

<br>

- We used a set of continuous-time, discrete-state Markov chain models to sample the character histories from their posterior probability distribution

--

- We fitted three different models to our data, using the function `make.simmap` from the [`phytools` `r emo::ji("package")`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/phytools/index.html) of `r icons::fontawesome("r-project")`, v. 1.0.1

--

- We estimated the prior distribution on the root node of the tree (`pi = 'estimated'`) and sampled the transition matrix, `Q`, from its posterior distribution (`Q = 'mcmc'`).

--

- We selected the most likely model of evolution based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC)

---

# Effects of maternal mass and foraging mode on reproductive output

- We used PGLS to model the relationship among maternal mass, foraging mode and reproductive output trough the `gls` function from the [`nlme` `r emo::ji("package")`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nlme/index.html) of `r icons::fontawesome("r-project")`, v. 3.1.153

--

- The slope of the linear relationship can be interpreted as reproductive effort—proportion of mass allocated to reproduction—which enabled us to avoid statistical issues associated with the analysis of ratios

--

- Models in which maternal mass was standardized (M) enabled us to deal with outliers, thus increasing the robustness of our conclusions

Our analysis provides evidence that  widely-foraging lizards have evolved greater reproductive effort, but only in heavier species. Food consumption may play an important role:

<br>

1) Promoting follicular growth during the reproductive season

<br>

2) Increasing energy stores to initiate reproduction

<br>

3) reducing age at first reproduction


---

.pull-left[

a) If two organisms have the same foraging efficiency, the smaller one would reach its maximal capacity to accumulate resources at a lower value of m, producing fewer or smaller offspring

<br>

b) If a widely-foraging species has a smaller body size but a higher foraging efficiency, it might invest more energy in reproduction than would a large sit-and-wait species

<br>

3) The same outcome should be observed if a widely-foraging species is larger and more efficient than a sit-and-wait species

# Concluding remarks

<br>

- The early shift in foraging mode—from sit-and-wait foraging to widely foraging—in the evolutionary history of lacertilians was likely accompanied by the evolution of a greater reproductive effort, specifically in large-bodied species of lizards

<br>

- Importantly, our study captured the effects of foraging plasticity on the reproductive effort of lizards. For instance, lizards that adopt a mixed-foraging strategy produced the greatest reproductive effort
